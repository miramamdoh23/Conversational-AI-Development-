# Tactful Academy Training Program

## Overview

This repository contains the complete training curriculum for Tactful Academy, designed to transform you from platform basics to advanced AI-powered conversational solutions.

---

## Program Goal

Master the Tactful ecosystem and demonstrate your ability to build end-to-end conversational AI solutions that combine rule-based logic with advanced AI capabilities.

---

## Module Structure

### Module 1: Core Platform Onboarding & Orientation
**Duration:** Foundation Level  
**Objective:** Understand what we sell and how it works manually before automating it.

#### Topics Covered

**Tactful Dashboard**
- Channel creation (e.g., Webchat)
- Widget settings
- Routing rules
- Exercise: Create a test channel and experiment with different routing rules

**The Studio**
- UI walkthrough: flows, step types, triggers, translations, config
- Flow settings and management
- Example: Build a simple welcome flow with a trigger and translation

**Configuration**
- Multi-language support (translations)
- Variables and dynamic content
- Actionable: Set up a variable for user names and test multi-language greetings

---

### Module 2: The AI Brain (LLMs & Vectors)
**Duration:** Intermediate Level  
**Objective:** Move from "Rules-Based" to "AI-Based" interactions.

#### Topics Covered

**LLM Fundamentals**
- OpenAI Service integration
- Prompts, Temperature, Tokens
- Exercise: Experiment with prompt engineering to see how responses change

**Vector Databases**
- Embeddings and semantic search
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Example: Store FAQs as embeddings and enable semantic search

**Hybrid Flows**
- Combining Studio flows with OpenAI API calls
- Actionable: Create a flow that uses both rules and AI for fallback answers

**Tools & Automation**
- Flowise & n8n overview
- Sample automations
- Exercise: Build a simple automation that triggers on specific user input

---

### Module 3: Advanced Flow Logic & Integrations
**Duration:** Advanced Level  
**Objective:** Connect the bot to external services and automate workflows.

#### Topics Covered

**Integration Services**
- AWS SES (Email notifications)
- Google Sheets (Read/Write data)
- Example: Send an email notification when a new contact is created

**Flowise & n8n**
- Workflow automation tools deep-dive
- Actionable: Automate data entry from chat to Google Sheets

**SDK & APIs**
- SDK functionality and usage
- Reflected APIs
- Authentication best practices
- Exercise: Review API authentication best practices

---

### Module 4: Data, Analytics & Schemas
**Duration:** Advanced Level  
**Objective:** Prove the bot is working through data analysis and reporting.

#### Topics Covered

**Database Schemas**
- Key tables: Conversations, Contacts, Logs
- Data relationships and flow
- Exercise: Map out how data flows between these tables

**Metabase**
- Creating dashboards
- Visualizing SQL queries
- Actionable: Build a dashboard to track user engagement

**Notebooks**
- Python/Jupyter for analytics
- Custom reports and deep-dive analysis
- Example: Analyze conversation logs for common user intents

---
